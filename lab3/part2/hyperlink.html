        <h2>A Film Review of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJnMQG9ev8" target="_blank">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></h2>

        <p><em>By <a href="mailto:kewenliu.kolvin@gmail.com">Kewen Liu</a>, the paper for WR120 at BU in 2021</em></p>

        <p>A broken world of fire and blood, killings for gasoline and water, deserts, acidic soils, collapsed civilization, nothing left except for the endless madness - as the fourth film of the Mad Max franchise released in 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road presents a new take on post-apocalyptic westerns, telling an extremely engaging story of survival, hope, and redemption.</p>

        <p>In the wasteland in Australia, a cult leader named Immortal Joe builds a citadel on the discovery of underground water and an army called War Boys. Serving under Immortal Joe, Imperator Furiosa betrays Joe during an inter-tribal trade to free the Five Wives of Joe. Max, originally a road cop, is seized by War Boys as a blood donor and is brought to the front line of the capture of Furiosa. As Furiosa and the Five Wives lose pursuers temporarily, Max also escapes from the army and joins Furiosa on the road trip to the Green Place, where Furiosa descends. After arriving at the destination, however, they find out that the Green Place has turned into a poisonous and putrid bog. Lamenting the vanished last hope, Furiosa listens to Max’s suggestion and leads the group to go back to the citadel to overturn the tyranny of Immortal Joe. In the end, they defeat Immortal Joe and display his body in front of the crowd. As people celebrate to their new leader Furiosa, Max blends into the crowd to his next adventure in the post-apocalyptic world.</p>
            
        <p>Mad Max: Fury Road is a complete blockbuster which wins a list of awards. It’s rated R because of the intense violence and potentially disturbing graphics of non-stop explosions, chase and fight, blood, stabbing, shooting, and deaths, but still, the images are epic. The film is mostly in a highly saturated orange tone which forms a sense of torridity and hyper-reality, whilst the contrasting stark cool blues create a mood of unease and danger. There is an insanely beautiful scene in the first half of the film where Furiosa runs the truck into a thunderstorm to avoid pursuers from Immortal Joe. As tornados engulf the pursuers’ cars and lightning crackles, short clips of the frame become black and white to resemble the flashes of lightning, which render a subtle sense of old western movies that adds richness to the flavor of the film. Moreover, tattoos, white-painted skins and grease-painted eyes, sandy battered cars and rigs, metal wheels with skull designs, blind guitarist with flame-puffing bass on the Doof Wagon in the front of the army, the elements of diesel-punk are throughout the details in the film. Graphics design and visual effects are marvelously crafted to deliver the sense of barbarism which forms a sharp contrast to the futuristic setting. This intentional contradiction of the setting successfully builds the craziness of the world with an entertaining touch of comedy and, again, creates a strong sense of hyper-reality. Another deep impression of the film to me is the astonishingly beautiful Five Wives portraited by supermodels, especially compared to other dusty and miserable characters in the movie. The white clothes foil their tan healthy skins. Makeup designs are artfully authentic. With the vibrant pallet of the frame, each shot of them is like an oil painting.</p>
            
        <p>Visuals are not the only merit of Mad Max 4. At first, Max and Furiosa with the Five Wives guard against each other very alertly, but they gradually develop trust and friendship as they tide over crisis and difficulties. In a world of extreme resource shortage, the development of such supporting relationship between the characters reveals the glimmers of humanity. Other than this, the glimmers shine more to feminism in the film, when the Five Wives rebel against Immortal Joe with the help of Furiosa to claim their own freedom, and when the female characters fight back with all their power to show strength and courage. More importantly, the film doesn’t end with Furiosa and Max getting together or developing any romantic relationship. This gives Furiosa full respect as a female character whose role is not to serve any male character romantically.</p>
            
        <p>Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely a movie that should be put on the watching list. As you watch the film, it will be just like unwrapping a precious gift.

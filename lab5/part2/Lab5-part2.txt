    I used fonts including trebuchet MS as Mac-friendly font and PC-friendly font, and sans-serif as generic font family.
    I used Media Queries to make a 2-column layout for a screen that's at least 768px wide, and the gallery has 2 photos on 
        a row. When the width of the browser gets smaller than 768px, the page layout becomes 1 column and the gallery
        will have 1 photo on each row.
    The section "How to take care of Zaizai" is hidden when the screen gets smaller than 768px.

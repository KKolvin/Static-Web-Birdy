new tags added: <hr>, comment tag, <i>, <caption>, <strong>

The similarity of <em> and <i> is that they both italicize characters, and <strong> and <b> both bolden characters.
The similarity is that the visual effect of them appear to be the same in web browser.
The difference is that <i> and <b> only play a visual role of making text in some certain styles (italicize, bolden), 
while <em> and <strong> have semantic meaning of marking up text as importance and words that need to be emphasized.
